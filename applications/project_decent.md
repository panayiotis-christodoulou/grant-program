### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

Brief Description of the project

The Global Agenda 2030 , a framework for sustainable development agreed upon by 193 states with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 232 indicators covers a broad range of social and economic development issues including poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water, sanitation, energy, environment, and social justice. Considering that Health & Safety at Work is a fundamental global value included in UN SDGs, the proposed project entitled "Decent.H&S" has as its main purpose to further enhance and optimize the processes that relate to safeguarding Occupational Health & Safety at work by leveraging on Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). DLTs such as blockchains, provide the means to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) through private-public partnerships. More specifically this project utilizes Blockchain technology as a response to specific challenges that relate to trust, security, privacy and transparency.  Occupational Health & Safety is recognised as a crucial element in achieving the sustainable operation of corporate organizations of all types and sizes, in maintaining their profitability and business continuity. At the same time, it is a fundamental and indisputable component of ensuring social peace, people's well-being and prosperity. By utilizing Blockchain technology we ensure efficient management of Occupational Health & Safety tasks, legal requirements and policies implementation enforcement, crucial decisions felicitation, corrective actions acceleration, improvement of systems and functions modernization, to all involved stakeholders.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
